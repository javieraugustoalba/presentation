    <h2>Basics of AI</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence involves creating algorithms that allow computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The primary goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that would ordinarily require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. AI systems use a combination of algorithms, machine learning techniques, and data analytics to simulate human intelligence.</p>
    <h2>AI and Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. Deep Learning, a subset of ML, makes the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible and helps to discover intricate patterns in large datasets. While AI encompasses a larger frame of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human capabilities, ML is specifically focused on developing algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>

        <h1>Commonly Used Models in AI</h1>
        <h2>Exploring Models That Power AI Applications</h2>        
        <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Primarily used for image processing and computer vision tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong> CNNs use convolutional layers that apply convolutional filters to the input data. These filters help the network to recognize patterns like edges, textures, and more complex patterns in higher layers.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Image classification, object detection, facial recognition, etc.</p>
        
        <h2>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ideal for sequential data processing and prediction.</p>
        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong> RNNs have loops to allow information persistence, meaning the information can be carried across sequences, making them suitable for tasks where context or chronological order is important.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Natural language processing, speech recognition, time-series prediction, etc.</p>
        
        <h2>Random Forest</h2>

        <h1>Types of Learning in AI</h1>
        <h2>Adopting Learning Strategies for Model Training</h2>
        
        <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means the desired output is already known.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on various features like location, size, and age.</p>
        
        <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Learning from an unlabeled dataset, trying to find hidden patterns and structures from the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Grouping customers into different segments based on purchasing behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Training a model to play chess or Go, where the model learns from each move.</p>
        
        <h2>Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training, often used when acquiring a fully labeled dataset is expensive or time-consuming.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Image recognition where labeling large amounts of data is impractical, and a small subset of labeled data helps guide the learning process with a larger set of unlabeled data.</p>
        
        <h2>Self-Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An unsupervised learning variant where the data itself provides supervision.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting the next word in a sentence where the model generates its own supervisory signal from the input data.</p>
        <p>Example: <a href="https://www.alphagomovie.com/">AlphaGo</a> - Utilized Reinforcement Learning to master the game of Go.</p>

    <h1>Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks</h1>
    
    <h2>Deep Learning:</h2>
    <p>Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It's particularly potent when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, like images or natural language text.</p>
    
    <h2>Neural Networks:</h2>
    <p>Neural Networks are algorithms intended to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input. These algorithms loosely mimic how a human brain operates, hence the name "Neural Networks".</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neurons:</strong> Basic units or nodes, inspired by biological neurons, which receive one or more inputs and produce an output.</li>
      <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Neural networks have three types of layers: input, hidden, and output layers.</li>
      <li><strong>Weights and Biases:</strong> Parameters within the network that are tuned during training to adjust outputs.</li>
      <li><strong>Activation Function:</strong> Determines if a neuron should be activated or not. Examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
    <p>CNNs are primarily used for image processing, pattern recognition, and image classification. They automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.</p>
    <h3>Key Concepts of CNNs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Convolutional Layer:</strong> The layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller picture windows to go through the input image.</li>
      <li><strong>Pooling Layer:</strong> Responsible for reducing the spatial size (width & height) of the input volume. It helps to decrease the computational power required to process data.</li>
      <li><strong>Fully Connected Layer:</strong> Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular Neural Networks and work on classifying the images.</li>
      <li><strong>Filter/Kernels:</strong> A filter is a smaller-sized matrix in terms of width and height but extends through the full depth of the input volume. Its role is to slide or convolve across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products.</li>
      <li><strong>Stride:</strong> The number of pixels by which the filter matrix slides over the input matrix.</li>
      <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Sometimes it is convenient to pad the input volume with zeros around the border, to control the spatial size of the output volumes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h2>
    <p>RNNs are used for sequential data like time series analysis, speech recognition, and language modeling. They have loops to allow information persistence.</p>
    <h3>Key Concepts of RNNs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recurrent Neuron:</strong> Unlike traditional neurons, a recurrent neuron sends information in a loop. It takes input from the previous step along with the regular inputs.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Cells:</strong> These are units that are responsible for remembering past information. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) are popular types of memory cells.</li>
      <li><strong>Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):</strong> A technique to train RNNs where the error is calculated and spread back through each time step.</li>
      <li><strong>Vanishing and Exploding Gradient Problem:</strong> Challenges faced during training RNNs due to the gradients tending towards zero or infinity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>LSTM and GRU:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):</strong> A special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies using mechanisms called gates.</li>
      <li><strong>GRU (Gated Recurrent Units):</strong> A simplified version of LSTMs which also use gating information to solve the vanishing gradient problem but with fewer parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CNNs:</strong> Image and Video Recognition, Image Analysis, Object Detection, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>RNNs:</strong> Speech Recognition, Time-Series Prediction, Natural Language Processing, etc.</li>

  </div>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>This project is dedicated to identifying individuals in a video stream who are either wearing or not wearing specific personal protective equipment (PPE). The system can identify various equipment like hardhats, masks, safety vests, and more. Here's a brief overview of its functionalities:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time Detection:</strong> Using YOLO for object detection in conjunction with computer vision libraries like OpenCV and cvzone.</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Classifying detected objects into different categories like 'Hardhat', 'Mask', 'NO-Hardhat', 'NO-Safety Vest', etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Color Coding:</strong> Color codes bounding boxes based on the classification results. For instance, a 'NO-Hardhat' detection is highlighted in red.</li>
    <li><strong>Frames Per Second (FPS) Display:</strong> Monitoring performance by calculating and displaying the FPS.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning ensures accurate detections, providing a valuable tool for safety monitoring in various environments.</p>
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
